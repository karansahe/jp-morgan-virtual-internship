Car Simulation
This project is a simple Python simulation of a car that allows the user to interact with its speed, odometer, and average speed. The program accepts user input to accelerate, brake, or display odometer and average speed values.

Features
Accelerate: Increases the car's speed by 5 units.
Brake: Decreases the car's speed by 5 units.
Odometer: Displays the total distance driven by the car.
Average Speed: Calculates and displays the car's average speed over time.
How It Works
The car starts with a speed of 0, an odometer reading of 0, and no time passed.
The user can interact with the car by accelerating, braking, checking the odometer, or getting the average speed.
The program runs continuously in a loop until interrupted by the user.
Usage
To run the simulation, simply execute the Python script. You'll be prompted to input one of the following options:

A to accelerate the car.
B to brake.
O to display the current odometer reading.
S to display the car's average speed.

Future Enhancements
Adding fuel consumption tracking.
Implementing a reverse gear.
Limiting speed changes to a realistic range.
